=> what are CSS-Selectors:
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements that you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

=> difference  between the jquery object and dom object:

The jQuery object and DOM (Document Object Model) object are related concepts in web development, but they have distinct differences.

jQuery Object:

Introduction: jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the process of working with the DOM and handling events, animations, and AJAX requests.
Creation: When you use jQuery to select elements from the DOM, it returns a jQuery object.
javascript
Copy code
var myElement = $('#myId'); // jQuery object
Methods: The jQuery object comes with its own set of methods and functions that you can use to manipulate the selected elements. These methods are designed to provide a simplified and consistent interface for various DOM operations.
javascript
Copy code
myElement.hide();
DOM Object:

Introduction: The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, text, etc.
Creation: When you use native JavaScript to select elements from the DOM using methods like getElementById or querySelector, you get a DOM object.
javascript
Copy code
var myElement = document.getElementById('myId'); // DOM object
Methods: DOM objects have their own set of methods and properties, and these are typically more low-level compared to the jQuery methods. You may need to use different methods for similar operations when working directly with DOM objects.
javascript
Copy code
myElement.style.display = 'none';
Key Differences:

Syntax:

jQuery uses a concise and consistent syntax, often employing the $ function to create jQuery objects.
DOM manipulation with native JavaScript involves using various methods and properties specific to the DOM API.
Abstraction:

jQuery abstracts away many cross-browser compatibility issues and provides a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to work with the DOM.
Working directly with the DOM requires handling cross-browser differences and may involve more verbose code.
Methods:

jQuery methods are designed to be chainable and often allow for more concise code.
DOM methods are generally more granular and might require more lines of code for equivalent operations.
In summary, while both jQuery and the DOM deal with the manipulation of web documents, jQuery provides a higher-level abstraction with a simplified and consistent API, while working directly with the DOM involves using native JavaScript methods and dealing with more low-level details.
